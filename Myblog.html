    <h2>1. What is Personal Finance?</h2>
    <p>Personal finance refers to the process of planning and managing your own money — including income, expenses, savings, investments, and insurance — to achieve financial stability, future security, and life goals.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>2. Budgeting Basics</h2>
    <p>Budgeting is planning your monthly income and expenses. It helps you control spending, avoid debt, and save money for future goals. A simple rule: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>3. Emergency Fund Importance</h2>
    <p>An emergency fund is money set aside for sudden needs like medical bills or job loss. Ideally, save 3–6 months' expenses. It gives peace of mind and keeps you away from loans in tough times</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>4. Saving vs Investing</h2>
    <p>Saving is keeping money safe (like in a savings account or FD).

Investing means putting money into assets (like mutual funds or stocks) to grow wealth over time.
Both are important — save for safety, invest for growth.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>5. Mutual Funds Explained</h2>
    <p>A mutual fund pools money from many people and invests it in stocks, bonds, or both. A fund manager handles the decisions. It’s an easy, low-risk way to grow money, even if you’re a beginner.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>6. Understanding Credit Scores</h2>
    <p>A credit score is a 3-digit number (300–900) that shows how trustworthy you are with loans or credit. A good score (750+) helps you get better loan deals. Pay EMIs on time and avoid too much debt to keep it healthy.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>7. Tax Planning Tips</h2>
    <p>Tax planning means using legal ways to reduce the amount of tax you pay. Invest in options like ELSS mutual funds, PPF, NPS, and insurance under Section 80C. Plan early in the year, not at the last minute.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>8. How to Pick Stocks</h2>
    <p>Start by checking company basics: profits, debt, future plans, and management. Look for strong brands with consistent performance. Never invest blindly — learn or take help. Also, diversify (don’t put all money in one stock).
</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-section">
    <h2>9. Financial Freedom Strategy</h2>
    <p>Financial freedom means having enough money to live life on your own terms — without worrying about monthly bills. To reach it:

    Save regularly

    Invest smartly

    Avoid debt

    Build multiple income sources
    It’s not about getting rich fast, it’s about growing wealth slowly and surely.</p>
